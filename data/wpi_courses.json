   "Title": "Introduction to Thermal Engineering",
   "Description": "Cat I (offered at least 1x per Year).Thermal engineering encompasses a broad range of topics that include the behavior of matter and energy and their interaction as part of a system with the surrounding environment. This course covers topics from the fields of thermodynamics and heat transfer. You will learn how to identify systems and to use thermodynamic analysis to describe the behavior of the system in terms of properties and processes. Heat transfer between systems is a fundamental part of many engineering disciplines. While thermodynamics provides the foundation for understanding the energy distribution in a system in equilibrium, heat transfer provides a means for determining the rates of energy transfer under a variety of conditions. Understanding how to apply these concepts is a powerful tool for the engineer, enabling the evaluation of material states (phases) under different conditions and the maximum efficiency achievable with various power cycles. After completing this course, you should be able to define and describe properties and processes used in thermodynamic analysis and the governing laws. You should also be able to define and describe the phenomena of conduction, convection, and radiation and apply the heat diffusion equation to determine the temperature distribution in objects subject to different thermal boundary conditions. Finally, you should be able to calculate the heat transfer rates for objects subject to different (and combined) modes of heat transfer."

   "Description": "Biomaterials are an integral part of medical devices, implants, controlled drug delivery systems, and tissue engineered constructs. Extensive research efforts have been expended on understanding how biologic systems interact with biomaterials. Meanwhile, controversy has revolved around biomaterials and their availability as a result of the backlash to the huge liability resulting from controversies related to material and processing shortcomings of medical devices. This course specifically addresses the unique role of biomaterials in medical device design and the use of emerging biomaterials technology in medical devices. The need to understand design requirements of medical devices based on safety and efficacy will be addressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if testing fails to account for synergistic interactions from chronic loading, aqueous environments, and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies are readily available to assess accelerated effects of loading in physiologic-like environments. This combined with subchronic effects of animal implants is a potential tool in assessing durability. It is difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total biologic environment. The ultimate determination of safety comes not only from following the details of regulations, but with an understanding of potential failure modes and designs that lowers the risk of these failures. This course will evaluate biomaterials and their properties as related to the design and reliability of medical devices."

It is also used to test a students comprehension and understanding of their formal coursework in life sciences, biomedical engineering and mathematics. Possible outcomes of the qualifying examination are:1. Unconditional Pass - The candidate satisfied a majority of the QEC according to all criteria.2. Conditional Pass with specific course work to address a specific deficiency - The candidate satisfied a majority of the QEC with the exception of a particular weakness in one of the areas of specialization. The QEC is confident that the weakness can be corrected by the candidate taking a particular course specific to the area of weakness. Upon completion of the designated course with a B grade or higher, the student advances to PhD candidacy.3. Fail with an opportunity to retake within 6 months  The QEC determined that the candidate had several weaknesses. However, the majority of the QEC determined that the student has the potential to be a successful PhD candidate and could address the weaknesses. In this case, the student will have an opportunity to repeat the exam, which must be accomplished with 6 months of the original exam. The second exam only has two possible outcomes; unconditional pass, or fail without opportunity to retake the exam.Students are required to take the Ph.D. qualifying examination no later than the fifth semester after formal admittance to the Ph.D. program.

The computer representation of this information about a user is called a user model, and systems that construct and utilize such models are called user modeling systems. A simple example of a user model would be an e-commerce site which makes use of the users and similar users purchasing and browsing behavior in order to better understand the users preferences. In this class, the focus is on obtaining a general understanding of user modeling, and an understanding of how to apply user modeling techniques.

What are gas or dust cloud limits of ignitability, or in other words, what is the range of temperature, pressure, and concentration in which a flame can ignite and propagate? 3. What is the relationship between the flame propagation rate and the associated explosion pressure, and how is it influenced by the combustibility properties of the gas or dust cloud? 4. How does the rate-of-pressure-rise affect the overall explosion hazard and the viability of various explosion protection measures? 5. How does pressure development within the flammable gas or combustible dust cloud relate to the blast wave pressures propagating away from the cloud and away from the equipment in which the explosion originated? The course explains the physical and thermochemical phenomena pertinent to these questions and provides a mathematical framework for characterizing and applying the answers."

Almost 200 years later, technologies such as Amper Music, LANDR, Cybernetic Poet, and Taroko Gorge have entered domains that have defined human creativity and expressivity. How are we to understand such systems and their output? To what extent can a machine voice that which is elementally human? To what extent are we mechanical or algorithmic in the process of composition? How do the natural and the naturalized relate to artifice and the artificial in this context? In this multidisciplinary course we will bring together computer science, literary studies, and music analysis to explore techniques and technologies including algorithmic composition, asemic writing, automatic writing, machine learning, and human-machine interaction. Project work might include creative, critical, or hybrid interventions concerned with compositional systems, literary works, and/or musical productions.Recommended background: understanding of basic music theory (e.g. MU 1511, Introduction to Music or MU 1611, Fundamentals of Music); and/or coursework in Creative Writing / English (e.g. EN 1251, Introduction to Literature, or EN 2219, Creative Writing, or EN 3219, Advanced Creative Writing); and/or work in Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine learning (e.g. CS 4100, 4341, 534, 539, or 540)."

How are we to understand such systems and their output? To what extent can a machine voice that which is elementally human? To what extent are we mechanical or algorithmic in the process of composition? How do the natural and the naturalized relate to artifice and the artificial in this context? In this multidisciplinary course we will bring together computer science, literary studies, and music analysis to explore techniques and technologies including algorithmic composition, asemic writing, automatic writing, machine learning, and human-machine interaction.

   "Description": "Cat II (offered at least every other Year).Patriarchal religious traditions are often characterized by masculine images of the Divine, cisgendered male religious authority, male-authored scriptures and a heteronormative gendered division of religious practices. As a result, men and cultural masculinity are differently valued than women and cultural femininity; this male-female binary leaves little room for practitioners who identify as nonbinary. In this discussion-focused course, we will engage representations of gender and sexuality in different traditions and their impact on larger social contexts from philosophical, theological and ethnographic perspectives. Among the questions we will explore: Why does the idea of a female or feminine YHWH, God or Allah bother us? Can feminine representations (such as the Devi, Shakti or Shekhinah) or nonbinary representations (such as two-spirit people in indigenous communities) facilitate gender equity? Do mystical traditions (such as the Zohar or Sufism) encourage gender fluidity? How do religions influence sexuality; how does sexuality intersect with creation myths and cosmogonies? Why is a Buddhist nun expected to bow to a Buddhist monk; why does the Catholic Church not recognize women, nonbinary and / or queer priests? This combination of theoretical and methodological conversations will offer students a forum in which to recast assumptions about individual and collective identity that permeate our cultural systems and structures."

   "Description": "Cat II (offered at least every other Year).This upper-level Spanish course explores the many ways in which Latin American authors, artists, filmmakers, photographers, and thinkers have responded to environmental concerns from colonial times to present day. Starting with Europeans first impressions of the New World, we will grapple with the interplay between local cultures and the expansion of global capitalism in Latin America by analyzing literary and cultural representations of, for instance, resource extraction of rubber, wood, and petroleum in the Amazon (Brazil, Per, Ecuador); maquiladora contamination and environmental migration in the borderlands (U.S.-Mexico); water defenders and neoliberalism (Chile, Bolivia); indigenous social movements in defense of land &amp; nature (Ecuador); eco-feminist parallels between oppression of women and nature (Honduras, Colombia); and natural disasters, especially in the age of the Anthropocene (Mexico, Puerto Rico). We will explore these issues and more to unearth the role of Latin American cultural production in bearing witness to and generating awareness of environmental crises. While always accounting for the regions complex and interwoven history of coloniality, inequality, and dependency, we will look for environmental justice solutions proposed at the intersection of art and activism. Several questions will guide our interpretations, which will be grounded in ecocritical theory: what do the studied works aim to achieve by appealing to harmony between the human and the non-human? What similarities or differences exist across countries, contexts, and genres? And how does Latin Americas ecological consciousness differ from that of other peripheries and centers? This course would be especially beneficial to students interested in project work at WPIs Project Centers in Latin America and the Caribbean and would count toward the HUA Requirement in Spanish, International and Global Studies, and Latin American &amp; Caribbean Studies.This course will be offered in 2021-22, and in alternating years thereafter."

   "Description": "How does one explore a theatrical world physically and emotionally with language and find emotional truth? This class will explore foundational acting techniques drawn from the teachings and legacy of Konstantin Stanislavski (1863 – 1938), a Russian actor, director, producer and founder of the Moscow Art Theatre. His “Stanislavski Method” is one of the most influential acting approaches in the 20thand 21st centuries. This approach will include analysis and exploration “on our feet” of such terms as unit, objective, subtext, action, among others, as well as focus on incorporating characterization and given circumstances. We will do this through in-class exercises, as well as monologue and sceneworkonstage and on video from a variety of texts that employ naturalistic language (for example, Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull, Tennessee William’s The Glass Menagerie, Lynn Nottage’s Sweat, and Theresa Rebeck’s Mauritius, among others.) Further, we will explore the historical and social background of these playwrights in order to contextualize the ideas and mores behind the drama. Additionally, each actor will be expected to do research in order to better prepare themselves to dive into these theatrical worlds. Beyond acting skills, the student will learn valuable skills in public speaking and in conveying clear, complex ideas."

Explicit solutions for dynamic response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, both damped and undamped, is derived for free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and forced vibration caused by different excitations. Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration response of both multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with distributed parameters. As the basis of modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained in advance by solving an associated generalized eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties of the vibration modes with respect to the stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved.

   "Title": "Surface Metrology",
   "Description": "This course emphasizes research applications of advanced surface metrology, including the measurement and analysis of surface roughness. Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPIs Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science. Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have received credit for ME 5371/MTE 5843/MFE 5843 Fundamentals of Surface Metrology or the Special Topics (ME 593/MTE 594/MFE 594) version of Fundamentals of Surface Metrology."

   "Description": "There are three major goals for this course: to establish the underlying principles of calculus, to reinforce students calculus skills through investigation of applications involving those skills, and to give students the opportunity to develop projects and laboratory assignments for use by first-year calculus students. The course will focus heavily on the use of technology to solve problems involving applications of calculus concepts. In addition, MME students will be expected to master the mathematical rigor of these calculus concepts so that they will be better prepared to develop their own projects and laboratory assignments. For example, if an MME student chose to develop a lab on convergence of sequence, he/she would be expected to understand the rigorous definition of convergence and how to apply it to gain sufficient and/or necessary conditions for convergence. The process of developing these first-year calculus assignments will enable the MME students to increase their own mathematical understanding of concepts while learning to handle mathematical and computer issues which will be encountered by their own calculus students. Their understanding of the concepts and applications of calculus will be further reinforced through computer laboratory assignments and group projects.

The course will begin with treatment of arithmetic, working through Euclids algorithm and its applications, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and its applications, multiplicative functions, the Chinese remainder theorem and the arithmetic of Z/n. This information will be carried over to polynomials in one variable over the rational and real numbers, culminating in the construction of root fields for polynomials via quotients of polynomial rings. Arithmetic in the Gaussian integers and the integers in various other quadratic fields (especially the field of cube roots of unity) will be explored through applications such as the generation of Pythagorean triples and solutions to other Diophantine equations (like finding integersided triangles with a 60 degree angle). The course will then explore cyclotomy, and the arithmetic in rings of cyclotomic integers. This will culminate in Gausss construction of the regular 5-gon and 17-gon and the impossibility of constructing a 9-gon or trisecting a 60-degree angle. Finally, solutions of cubics and quartics by radicals will be studied. All topics will be based on the analysis of explicit calculations with (generalized) numbers. The proposed curriculum covers topics that are part of the folklore for high school mathematics (the impossibility of certain ruler and compass constructions), but that many teachers know only as facts. There are also many applications of the ideas that will allow the teachers to use results and ideas from abstract algebra to construct for their students problems that have manageable solutions."

We will use the visual arts to study the economic behavior of individuals, businesses, government, and other institutions and draw parallels to modern economies. We will learn, for example, about the tulip mania, the first documented speculative asset bubble, and discover that the Dutch were not that different from the exuberant traders of the modern stock market. The course will cover relevant topics in economic theory and will provide opportunities for students to conduct basic economic analysis.

   "Description": "What is a smart and sustainable city? What shapes it? How does its history influence its future? How do physical forms and institutions vary from city to city, and how are these changes meaningful? How are cities changing, and what is the future of cities? This course explores these and other questions, focusing on international cities in the late twentieth century. Two areas of focus in this seminar are the physical patterns and socio-ecological processes underpinning urban change. On the one hand, cities are characterized by spatial patterns of grey and green infrastructure from downtown and inner city to suburb and edge city; on the other, they are driven by a host of social rules and norms, as well as dynamic and increasingly unpredictable ecological processes. These questions and more are explored through lectures, readings, videos, case studies, and guest speakers."

   "Description": "Global environmental change, especially climate change, is already proving to be a grand challenge to societies, ecosystems, and economies. While climate change impacts vary globally, people and governments are striving to reduce exposure to environmental risks and trying to design socio-ecological responses to improve welfare. Taking climate change as a starting point, this course introduces students to a wide range of climate change conditions, human responses to those conditions, and points toward the need for deeper understanding of human-environment relationships. The course will draw from Geography, Economics, Global Environmental Change, and other cross cutting disciplines for theory and case studies. Examples of climate change risks and mitigation efforts will come from the developed and developing world and will include both urban and rural examples. Assessment techniques include small group projects, case based testing, and in class and online discussions. The course will also reinforce monitoring, evaluation, and learning techniques with students and faculty who will design desired course outcomes and procedures. At the end of this course students will be able to discuss and describe differential climate change impacts, human mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and make educated contributions to climate change mitigation policies and programs."

   "Description": "Cat II (offered at least every other Year).Environmental issues present some of the major international problems and opportunities facing the world today. Worst-case scenarios envision irrevocable degradation of the earths natural systems, but virtually every analysis sees the need for major change worldwide to cope with problems such as global warming, deforestation, ozone layer depletion, loss of biodiversity, and population growth, not to mention exponential increases in conventional pollutants in newly industrialized countries. The global environment issues represent a second-generation of environmental policy in which the focus of concern has moved from national regulations to international law and institutions. In addition, the environment has emerged as a major aspect of international trade, conditioning corporate investment and accounting for some $200 billion in sales of pollution control equipment in 1991. Exploration of the genesis and implications of these phenomena is the essence of the course. Topically, the material begins with the nature of global environmental problems, drawing on literature from large-scale global modeling as well as particular analyses of the problems mentioned above. Approximately half the course focuses on international laws and institutions, including multilateral treaties (e.g., the Montreal Protocol limiting CFC use, ocean dumping, biodiversity), international institutions (UNEP, the Rio Convention, the OECD) and private initiatives (international standards organizations, ICOLP (Industry Committee for Ozone Layer Protection), etc.) In addition, US policy toward global environmental issues will be compared with that in Japan, Europe and developing countries, from which it differs significantly.

   "Description": "How do contemporary engineers, technologists and other design professionals think about the relationship between ethics and design? Design is not simply about making objects or improving the customers experience, but also about restructuring the conditions of human and nonhuman life. Seen from this broader perspective, design lies at the heart of most of our current debates on social equality, cultural diversity, and environmental justice. In this course, our goal is to move beyond a view of design ethics as a reflection of the individual designer's intentions and responsibility. We will thus consider the extent to which professional codes of ethics, while perhaps being indispensable to modern professional associations, are useful for understanding the complex issues emerging in design practices. Moving the focus from the individual designer to historical and social contexts, we will think about the kinds of politics and communities that design practices can make possible."
